A basic paper mario rpg like.

I didn't get as much done as I had wished unfortunately. Should've gone to more office hours and all.

However, there are two individual parts that do work. The overworld with the ability to go into battles, and the battles itself.

With the battle there are four different options, fighting, using magic, combining items, and running away.

CONTROLS

Overworld:

WASD - Movement

Battle:

A/D & Left/Right - Action Movement

Space - Action Confirm

Esc - Action Cancel
